	<p>Time Complexity: It measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. It's typically expressed using Big O notation. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) means that its runtime grows linearly with the input size. As the input size doubles, the runtime also doubles.</p>

Time and <b>Space complexity</b>are concepts used in computer science to analyze the efficiency of algorithms.

Time Complexity: It measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. It's typically expressed using Big O notation. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) means that its runtime grows linearly with the input size. As the input size doubles, the runtime also doubles.

Space Complexity: It measures how the memory (space) required by an algorithm grows as the input size increases. Similar to time complexity, it's also expressed using Big O notation. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) means that it requires a linear amount of memory with respect to the input size.</p>
